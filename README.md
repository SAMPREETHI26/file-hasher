# hash-collision-detection
Hash collision detection among multiple files using several hashing algorithms like "md5", "sha1", "sha224", "sha256", "sha384", "sha512", "sha3_224", "sha3_256", "sha3_384", "sha3_512", "blake2b", "blake2s", "ripemd160"
file integrity monitoring 
metadata extracting using Exif for image MIME type
project is done using python and SQLlite database with some libraries like hashlib
